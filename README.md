# RTD PT100 Sensor Signal Conditioning 
RTD'S are resistive temperature sensors based on the variation of the resistance of a conductor to temperature. Here, we study the conditioning of a signal generated by a simulated RTD, based on a graphical user interface implemented in MATLAB, which works under two modes of operation. This interface, in turn, is designed to comply with a temperature control ON-OFF according to the ranges specified by the user.
